## Overview

F1 Predictor is a data and simulation suite that pairs a Cloudflare Worker cache with a React-based championship simulator. The system solves a core problem for motorsport analytics: race data is dynamic, APIs are rate-limited, and simulations need consistent inputs. I built an AutoCache Worker that normalizes and caches data, then layered a Monte Carlo engine on top to generate season outcomes under custom scenarios.

## Architecture

- **AutoCache Worker**: Cloudflare Worker that fetches standings and race results from the Jolpi/Ergast API, normalizes data, and publishes JSON/CSV endpoints.
- **KV-backed cache**: Hourly cron updates with a 6-hour post-race refresh window to reduce API load while staying current.
- **Simulator UI**: React + Vite app that consumes the Worker API and renders probabilities, deltas, and progression charts.
- **Fallback strategy**: The simulator falls back to the upstream API if the Worker is unavailable.

## How The Simulation Works

1. **Baseline**: Loads current standings from the AutoCache Worker.
2. **Scenario rules**: Applies custom constraints like driver locks, finishing orders, or bias curves.
3. **Monte Carlo engine**: Runs 1000+ iterations per mode to compute win probabilities.
4. **Aggregation**: Produces championship projections and per-driver outcome distributions.

## Why It Matters

- **Reliable data layer** for fast UIs without API throttling.
- **Experiment-friendly** interface for what-if race scenarios.
- **Production-ready** worker design with cron scheduling and KV persistence.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, KV Storage, Wrangler
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Language/Tooling**: TypeScript, ESLint, Cloudflare Vite plugin
- **Data Sources**: Jolpi/Ergast F1 API
