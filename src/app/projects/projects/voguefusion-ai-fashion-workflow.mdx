## Overview

VogueFusion is an AI workflow that compresses the fashion design-to-production cycle. It generates apparel concepts from structured inputs, estimates manufacturing cost from the resulting designs, and analyzes seasonal trends so teams can decide what to build with confidence.

## What It Does

- **AI design generation**: Converts fabric type, style constraints, and trend keywords into high-resolution fashion concepts.
- **Cost prediction**: Estimates dye costs from dominant color analysis and optimizes mixtures for price efficiency.
- **Trend intelligence**: Mines seasonal imagery to surface current, emerging, and fading styles.

## How It Works

### 1) Generative Design Pipeline
- Uses **ComfyUI** with SDXL-based models like **DreamShaperXL** and fine-tuned LoRAs for fashion-specific outputs.
- Inputs (fabric, silhouette, keywords, trend signals) are converted into prompt templates and rendered into high-resolution variants.
- Outputs move to the cost pipeline for pricing and feasibility checks.

### 2) Cost Prediction Engine
- Each design is analyzed for dominant colors and frequency.
- A **genetic algorithm** searches dye combinations that match the RGB palette while minimizing cost.
- Prices are aggregated from a dye-cost dataset to output a final estimate.

### 3) Trend Analysis Pipeline
- A custom dataset (200 images per season across five years) is scraped using the **Pinscrape API**.
- Keywords are extracted and clustered to identify macro patterns by season and category.
- The trend layer annotates designs with current / emerging / fading signals for decision support.

## Technical Highlights

- **Model stack**: SDXL + LoRA fine-tuning for style consistency and control.
- **Data engineering**: Multi-season dataset with keyword clustering for trend analytics.
- **Optimization**: Genetic algorithm for price-aware color formulation.
- **Pipeline design**: One workflow that unifies creative, cost, and market insight.

## Impact

VogueFusion demonstrates an end-to-end AI workflow that connects design generation, pricing, and trend intelligence. It highlights model orchestration, data engineering, and optimization skills aligned to production constraints.
